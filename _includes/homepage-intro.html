<h1>ðŸ§¬ LifeStack</h1>
<p><strong>A modular philosophy for intentional living.</strong></p>

<p>LifeStack explores the interconnected layers of life â€” how we nourish, cleanse, and build systems that align with our values. Inspired by the architecture of a technology stack, LifeStack invites readers to live intentionally through three modular practices:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cook</strong> â€” Nourish the body and mind</li>
  <li><strong>Clean</strong> â€” Achieve clarity and emotional balance</li>
  <li><strong>Build</strong> â€” Create systems and shape the world</li>
</ul>
