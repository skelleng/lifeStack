# 🧜️ LifeStack

**A modular philosophy for intentional living.**

LifeStack is a framework for exploring the **layers of life that make us whole**—how we nourish, cleanse, and build systems that align with our values. Inspired by the architecture of a technology stack, LifeStack invites readers to consciously structure their lives across three domains: **Cook**, **Clean**, and **Build**.

In a world where traditional roles are blurring and personal evolution is nonlinear, LifeStack encourages a modern, holistic lifestyle—where your habits, inner world, and creative output are all integrated into one intentional existence.

## ✨ Ethos

At its core, LifeStack believes that **life is modular**. Each layer—Cook, Clean, and Build—serves a distinct role, but together, they form a balanced whole. Just as a well-designed tech stack integrates databases, logic, and user interfaces, a well-lived life blends nourishment, clarity, and impact.

We believe modern individuals must embody **both traditional and modern roles**:
- To **nourish** their bodies and spirits  
- To **clear** the noise that blocks truth  
- To **build** systems that reflect their values  

This isn’t self-help. It’s **system design for your life**.
