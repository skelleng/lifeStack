# 🏝️ Why I'm Not Rushing to Buy Property in Bali  
*(And Maybe You Shouldn’t Either)*

Bali is beautiful, inspiring, and intoxicatingly free.  
But when it comes to **buying property**, especially on a 25-year leasehold?

> It’s not the investment opportunity many foreigners believe it is.  
> It’s a countdown clock disguised as an asset.

<!--more-->

Foreigners in Bali often race to sign leasehold agreements—motivated by hype, FOMO, and dreams of ROI through Airbnbs, cafes, or co-living spaces. But let’s zoom out and think strategically:

---

## 🧱 1. Leaseholds Don’t Build Legacy

Most foreign buyers in Bali don’t actually own the land—they lease it for 25 to 30 years. After that?  
You're done. You can't will it to your children. You can't resell the land. And if the land's value appreciates, you don’t benefit from it like a freeholder would.

> Leaseholds are glorified long-term rentals, and **you’re racing against time** to recover your investment.

---

## 🧠 2. You’re Betting on an Unpredictable Legal Landscape

Indonesia’s laws regarding foreign property ownership are nuanced and **can shift with political tides**.

- Leasehold extensions aren’t guaranteed
- Legal enforcement can be inconsistent
- Properties are often registered under nominee names
- Contracts depend heavily on who you’re dealing with

If you're not extremely careful (and working with the right notary), your "asset" could vanish overnight.

---

## 🏚 3. Villas Age Fast in the Tropics

Bali is a paradise—but also a hostile climate for buildings.

- Heat + Humidity = mold, rot, and water damage
- Salt in the air = metal corrosion
- Earthquakes, termites, flooding, and pests

If you're buying a secondhand villa, expect to **spend thousands** maintaining, upgrading, and retrofitting it to survive.

---

## 🌱 4. Buy Land, Not Someone Else’s Mistake

Instead of inheriting poor design choices, bad plumbing, and weak insulation—buy land and build smart:

- Modular architecture
- Low-maintenance materials (steel, composite, concrete)
- Sustainable, tropical-appropriate design
- Solar + water filtration + cross ventilation

> Owning the design means **owning the cost curve**.

---

## 🌍 5. FOMO Isn’t an Investment Strategy

So many buyers justify leasehold purchases with:

- “Everyone’s doing it”
- “It’ll rent on Airbnb”
- “I’ll flip it in 10 years”

The problem? Leaseholds **depreciate** as they age.  
So your villa is literally worth *less* every year.  
And if travel trends shift? You’re holding a liability.

---

## 🧾 6. Foreign Assets ≠ True Equity

If you're American, Australian, Canadian, or from most Western nations — **foreign property isn’t easily counted toward your personal net worth** by domestic banks.

So if you buy land or leaseholds in Bali with cash:
- You’re draining capital from your **home country** asset pool
- You reduce your **borrowable equity**
- You can't leverage that property for future financing

### ✅ Smarter Strategy?

**Use a mortgage against property in your home country** to fund your Bali project.  
You retain liquidity, gain leverage, and protect yourself from local volatility.

## 💡 Final Thoughts

Bali is magic — no doubt.  
But don’t confuse the vibe with viable investment logic.

> Think like a builder.  
> Act like a strategist.  
> Avoid the hype cycle.

---

## 🛠️ What to Do Instead

- Consider buying a **lot**, not a home
- Build modular, sustainable, future-ready housing
- Rent long-term before buying *anything*
- Talk to locals, lawyers, and builders—not just agents
