# Europe is Offline by Design. Why That's a Feature, Not a Bug

Try asking a Parisian café for the Wi-Fi password. You’ll likely get a shrug. And maybe that’s a good thing.

## 🧘‍♂️ Unplugged by Design

Europe doesn’t lack tech—it deprioritizes it. You don’t find QR menus, automated espresso bots, or charging ports on every table. Instead, you get eye contact, ambiance, and moments.

In Florence, I got lost. My phone was dead. A local shopkeeper sketched directions on a napkin. That route—guided by bell towers—was more memorable than any GPS dot.

## 💡 Why That Matters

Tech convenience trains us to skip the present. But being 'offline' in Europe isn’t about rejection. It’s about choice.
