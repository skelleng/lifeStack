## 🏛️ Focus by Environment

Baroque buildings don’t ping. They envelop you.

Inspired by Roman piazzas and cathedrals, I redesigned my workspace:
- No phone on desk  
- Bookended day with walking rituals

## 🛠️ Tools to Reclaim Flow

- Sunsama (timeblocking)  
- Bose QC45 Headphones  
- Forest App (screen time management)

## 💬 Final Thought

Architect your attention like a city: with intention, zones, and walls.
