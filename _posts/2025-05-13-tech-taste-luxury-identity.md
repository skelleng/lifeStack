# Tech Taste: Luxury, Identity, and Algorithms in Travel

In Milan I bought a jacket I saw on Instagram. In Doha, I watched influencers film luxury unboxings at hotels. Who's curating your taste?

## 🛍️ The Algorithm Wears Prada

Today, your wardrobe is less curated by stylists and more by AI.

Fashion aggregators know your budget, color palette, and preferred silhouettes. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok act as passive stylists, feeding you a stream of influencer content designed to nudge taste — and spending.

In Milan’s Via Montenapoleone district, I walked past a boutique I’d never heard of. Ten minutes later, I saw the same store featured in an Instagram ad tailored to my location. That ad showed the very same leather jacket I had tried on but didn’t buy — until I saw the algorithm nudge me. I tapped through, and two clicks later, the jacket was mine.

## 🤳 Identity for Sale

As travelers, we assume we’re exploring the world freely. But algorithmic feeds follow us wherever we go. In hotel lobbies, airports, and shopping districts, we're often seeing **the same global brands, styled by the same trend cycles**, no matter the city.

Luxury no longer whispers; it **signals**. Through reels, unboxings, and “haul” content, we’re watching taste become a performance — engineered for clicks.

And it begs the question: *Who are we dressing for — ourselves, or the feed?*

## 💼 Digital Influence, Physical Decisions

The intersection of tech and fashion is lucrative — but increasingly inauthentic. The dopamine hit of algorithm-driven fashion may satisfy the short-term desire to belong, but it often leaves us feeling empty or misrepresented.

We think we’re choosing what to wear, what to buy, where to shop — but in truth, we’re participating in a digital funnel optimized for conversion, not expression.

Travel used to shape identity through **discovery**. Now, more often, it reshapes us through **reinforcement**.

## ✨ Final Thought

True style isn’t algorithmically safe. It’s expressive, raw, and sometimes even impractical. It comes from **human friction** — trying something weird, stepping into a shop you weren’t targeted for, choosing color over consensus.

In the end, taste isn’t what gets the most likes. It’s what feels like you — even if the feed doesn’t understand it.

**Unplug the scroll. Walk into the unknown. And wear what your algorithm would never suggest.**
