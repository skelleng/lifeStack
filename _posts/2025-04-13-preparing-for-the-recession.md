## 📈 What to Buy in a Bearish Market

Recessions often see certain asset classes weathering the storm better than others. Historically, **defensive stocks, commodities like gold, and high-quality bonds** have been safe harbors. On the other hand, speculative tech stocks, cryptocurrencies, and highly leveraged businesses may face steeper declines.

**Key Considerations:**
- Look for companies with strong balance sheets, low debt, and stable dividends.
- Consider ETFs or mutual funds focused on consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities.
- Hedge your portfolio with small allocations to precious metals or other non-correlated assets.

- **Studying historical approaches**: For instance, examining how Trump’s cabinet or influential financial leaders handled past crises can offer insights.  
- **Diversified influencers**: Not all good ideas come from the financial world—look to innovative tech founders, seasoned politicians, and cultural thought leaders who navigate uncertainty well.
